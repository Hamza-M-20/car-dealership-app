PROJECT TITLE 
Car Dealership App
A full stack web application built with Django and react stack and custom authentication where users can easily register, login, signout, view all cars at the landing page, with links to each car to take you on the details page, where only the signed in user has some aspects to the application like create, edit,update, delete and see all the reviews. also see all the dealerships.

This is my plan for project 4 for the car dealership app.

## USER STORIES

- AAU when i get on the landing page, i should be to see the different cars in each dealerships.
- AAU when i log-in, i should be able to explore all dealerships, with full information and prices.
- AAU i should be able to create, update, edit and delete a dealership.
- AAU i want to stay logged-in untill i log out or my token expires so that i dont have to log-in everytime.
- AAU i should be able to create and read also reviews from other users.
- AAU if i enter invalid credentials, i should get an error message.

## STRETCH GOALS

- AAU i would like to be able to easily filter, advanced searches and sort cars depending on what im looking for.
- Integrate live chats.
- Integrate maps in the app so i can easily find dealerships and also dealerships near me.
- E-mail notifications when someone registers on the app.
- Car comparison feature side by side so that i can see prices, mileage and features.
- Include contact seller button through a link opens email with pre-filled message.

My ERD shows how many parts of my project data base are related.
Four tables include user, dealership, cars and reviews.
Basically a dealership can have many cars and a car can have many reviews.
Each review comes from one user and every car belongs to specific dealership and owner.
